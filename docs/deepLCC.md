# Structured Optimal Control

Due to the limit of communication abilities in practice, 
the CAV can only receive partial information of the global 
traffic system for its feedback. Therefore, it is important to consider the local 
available information of the neighboring vehicles. 
This leads to the notion of structured controller design.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

To run the code, the Modeling package, [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/), and the optimization solver, [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/), are needed to solve the semidefinite program in controller synthesis.


YALMIP:

Please install YALMIP using the provided link. Follow the Tutorial in the YALMIP website and download the YALMIP file. Once you obtained the YALMIP folder. We can put the whole YALMIP folder into our project folder.

MOSEK:

Please follow the installation instruction in MOSEK website to install MOSEK on your machine. ** Please remember to apply a license from the MOSEK website. After obtaining the license, you can put it in your project folder and your system document MOSEK path.** The path is different depends on your system.

Add path and initialization
```matlab

```

Key parameters setting. The comm_limited indicated that whether there is communication constraint. While the CR indicate the communication range if there is communication constraint.
```matlab
comm_limited = 1;
CR = 5; 
```

Experiment parameter setting: 

N indicate the total number of vehicle in the experiment. V_star indicate the equilibrium velocity.

```matlab
N = 20;
V_star = 15;

alpha  = 0.6+0.1-0.2*rand(N,1);
beta   = 0.9+0.1-0.2*rand(N,1);

```

Cost Function Weight Setting:

- gamma_s means the preference setting of vehicle spacing.

#### Functions

##### [system_model.m](https://github.com/soc-ucsd/mixed-traffic/blob/main/structured_optimal_control/_fcn/system_model.m)

This function take the a series of parameters setting as input to generate the system model paramters (A,B1,B2,Q,R).

- Q is the Kalman controllability matrix
- A and B is the matrix paramters for the linearized state-space model for the mixed traffic system x˙(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
- R is calculated by gamma_u*eye(AV_number,AV_number) Both Q and R consist of the system-level performance output z. Indicating that we allow the perturbation to arise from anywhere in the traffic flow, and the performance output z(t) takes into account all the vehicles’ deviations in the traffic flow. This
setup indicates a system-level consideration.

## Experiment Results
### Experiment A
The numerical experiments tested the proposed controller alongside whether or not the proposed condition (equation 28 in the reference paper) for CAV spacing was satisfied. For this, a traffic system of 19 HDVs and 1 CAV was tested on a ring-road setup. Resulting velocity of each vehicle was graphed.

![Alt Text](images/structured_optimal_control/Structured-optimal-results.png)

The above figure is the velocity profile of each vehicle (Experiment A). (a) All the vehicles are HDVs. (b)—(f) One vehicle is CAV with the proposed method. The desired equilibrium velocity 'v*' is 15 m/s, 16 m/s, 14 m/s in (b), (c)(e), (d)(f), respectively. In (b)(c)(d) the value of s<sub>1</sub>* is determined according to the spacing condition, whereas in (e)(f) the spacing condition is not satisfied.

### Experiment B
Experiment B is conducted to test the controller’s ability to dissipate stop-and-go waves. A random noise following the normal distribution, N (0, 0.2), is added to the acceleration signal of each vehicle. This corresponds to the traffic situations where small perturbations are generated naturally inside the traffic flow.

![Alt Text](images/structured_optimal_control/ExpB.png)

The above figure is the velocity profile and trajectory of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 19th vehicle (Experiment B). In (b), the darker the color, the lower the velocity. From t = 0 seconds to t = 300 seconds and from t = 450 seconds to t = 700 seconds, the proposed controller does not work and all the vehicles are human-driven, while from t = 300 seconds to t = 450 seconds, the proposed controller at vehicle no.1 is activated.

### Experiment C
Experiment C, compares the proposed strategy with two existing heuristic ones: FollowerStopper and PI with Saturation. A perturbation induces a traffic wave in the road setup, and the CAV is used to dissipate a traffic wave, and the time taken with the strategy is compared with the heuristic methods. 

![Alt Text](images/structured_optimal_control/ExpC.png)

The above figure lists vehicle trajectories for all vehicles in Experiment C. (a) All the vehicles are humandriven. (b)-(d) correspond to the cases where vehicle 2,11,20 is under the perturbation, respectively.

The following are the comparison graphs for all three strategies : 

![Alt Text](images/structured_optimal_control/Comp1.png)

The above figure lists vehicle Spacing in Experiment C. Vehicle no.6 is under the perturbation. The grey line and the blue line denote the spacing of HDV
and CAV, respectively. (a) All the vehicles are HDVs. (b)-(d) correspond to the cases where the CAV is using FollowerStopper, PI with Saturation and the optimal control strategy, respectively.

![Alt Text](images/structured_optimal_control/Comp2.png)

The above figure is a comparison of results at different positions of the perturbation in Experiment C. (a) The maximum spacing of the CAV during the overall process, i.e., max s1(t). (b) The linear quadratic cost for the traffic system, as defined in equation 21 of the reference paper.
